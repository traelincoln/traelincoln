## Hello, Welcome to my Github Profile

## About Me
My name is Trevour Chidoti, I am <span id="age">26 years old</span>, I am an engineering student by day and a writer, blogger and full stake web developer by night. I am learning computer science and web development on line with [HavardX](cs50.harvard.edu/web) on [Edx](edx.org). I am studying Aeronautical Engineering (aka aircraft design) with The University of Zimbabwe.
## Web Skills
I use Git, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, Javascript, Ruby for web development. I have experience with, Jekyll, Github Pages, Bootstrap and Jquery and building web apps with React and other javascript frame works. For backends I use Django, PHP and Node. I can also integrate web apps with AI.
## Interests
I like making educational content and sharing my demos on youtube, and I also enjoy writing and designing on my personal blogs. It pairs well with my skills and I get to talk directly to people and share some knowledge. Otherwise, I also enjoy playing tennis, listening to music and reading books.
