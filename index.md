# Welcome 👋🏿
Hello, my name is **Trevour L Chidoti**, welcome to my Github pages profile page. Please feel free to look around. 

Github is where I, and many other software devolpers, like to store our software online for easy sharing and hosting. So, I have made this page as a short profile about my self and a linktree to all my code, online projects.
You can view the files in [my public repositories][2] and the links will be in project description or down at the links section down below.

# About Me 👨🏿‍💻
I am a _Software Developer_ and an _Engineering Student_ from Harare.
I am studying _Aeronautical Engineering_ with The University of Zimbabwe, and I am also learning _Web Development_ online using `Python` and `Javascript` with [Harvardx][11] on [edX][10]. 

# My Skills 👨🏿‍💻

The programming languages that I am really good with so far are:

- ```HTML```

# My Hobbies ⛷️🎿

I enjoy reading books and designing computer programs and aircraft. I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery, and making games and quizzes. I also enjoy taking pictures, going for walks and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy, and I like movies too.

> When I am not reading up on aerodynamics, I am studying computer science and web-design.
