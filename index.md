## About Me
My name is *Trevour L Chidoti*, I am a _Blogger_, a _Scientific Writer_, a _Developer_ and an _Engineering student_ from Harare.
I am doing _Aeronautical Engineering_ with The University of Zimbabwe, and I am also learning _Web Development_ using `Python` and `Javascript` online with HavardX through Edx. My github account is where I store my files online for easy sharing and hosting. 

You can view the files in [my public repositories][2] and the links to the live sites will be in each repository's description. 

You can also visit: 
- [My github account][2] where I store the source code for my projects
- [A mock Google Search page](https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites/) that I made for cs50w project 0.
- [My Blog](https://traelincoln.github.io/traelincoln).

  - HTML 
  - CSS

  - PYTHON (including DJANGO and machine learning)
  - PHP
  - RUBY

## My Hobbies ⛷️🎿
I enjoy reading books, designing computer programs and aircraft. 
When I am not reading up on aerodynamics, I will be studying computer science and web-design. 
I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery.
Outside of school I also enjoy, taking pictures, walking, reading and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy but I also like reggae and pop. And movies, I like movies too.


## Contribution, how it works

If you visit [my github profile][2], you can see the source code to all the work I have made public in the folders named `repositories`. The links to live sites will be in each repository's discription and you can read more about each project in the `README.md` file.

For example, go to [My Profile][2], >> open the [`/cs50w-websites`][3], you will see the `README.md` with a short description of the project, >> open the [`/docs`][4] folder to see the source code for the project. A link to the live site, <https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites> , will be in the description.

If you want to support any of the projects, please feel free to **Buy me a beer!** through the link link in the project discription.


You should feel free to `clone` any of my public repos or ask to make edits via a `pull requests`.
