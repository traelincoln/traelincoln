This is my github account were I store all my work online. This is a little profile that I have made for myself. 
Please feel free to take a look at, clone or fork any my public repositories üìÅ or ask for access. You can also check out [My Mock Google Search Page](traelincoln.github.io/cs50-websites)

## So, who is Trevour L Chidoti? 
I am a writer, a developer and an engineering student. 
I'm from Zimbabwe and I am studying **Aeronautical Engineering** with The University of Zimbabwe.
And I am also learning web-development using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON online through Edx.
I enjoy reading books, designing computer programs.
And right now I am really into building blogs and static web-pages. 
I am working on my personal blog and finding my voice as writer.
I am learning by trail and error right now but I think we are getting somewhere.
##
<blockquote> My goal is to be able to write programs and build web-sites proffesionally and to graduate with an engineering degree by 2024. </blockquote>

## My education
I went to Wits University and studies a Bachelor's degree in Aeronautical Engineering for three years from 2017 to 2019. Then I took a gap year from 2020 to 2021 when I wasn't feeling well, I then transfered to University of Zimbabwe to finish that same degree in end of 2021 which is where I am now in 2022. I hope to graduate before en of year 2024. Currently I am also pursuing a proffesional certificate in computer science with Havardx online, which is a program that is being administered via Edx. I hope to finish that before end of year 2022.

## My skills
### *Writing* 
Above all things, I am a writer. I can write pretty much anything, research, technical reports, personal documents, assignments (for myself), letters anything. I could probably right a book.

### *Engineering and Design* 
Design is such a broad word, and topic. In engineering you're taught design, in web-development you learn design and for anything and everything that you do you have to learn to design it. And so I consider myself a designer in the broadest senss but also in the engineering sense. Give me enough time and could *CAD* anything and I can make anything. I am currently working on a composite glider for my 3rd year project.

### *Computer Programming* 
Of late computer pragraming has taken over my life. I learnt programming in school but now I am learning computer science in broadest sense, and so far I have mastered web-development. I just need to get some certificates to show for it, which what I am working on right now
