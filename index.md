## My Hobbies ‚õ∑Ô∏èüéø
I enjoy reading books, designing computer programs and aircraft. 
When I am not reading up on aerodynamics, I will be studying computer science and web-design. 
I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery.
Outside of school I also enjoy, taking pictures, walking, reading and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy but I also like reggae and pop. And movies, I like movies too.

## Contribution (How it works)
I you visit my github profile, <github.com/traelicoln> , you can see the source code to all the work I have made public, open source, in the folders named `repositories`, and the links to those sites, which are hosted for free by github are in each repository's discription. You can read more about the motivation behind each project in the `README.md` file.
For example the files for the mock google home page I made live in the folder <github.com/traelincoln/cs50w-websites/docs> and the site itself is live at <https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites>. 
You should feel free to `clone` any of my public repos or ask to make edits via `pull requests`. And if you want to support any of the projects, feel free to *Buy me a beer!*
