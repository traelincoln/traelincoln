## About Me
My name is Trevour Chidoti, I am <span id="age">26 years old</span> and I am writer, blogger and full stake web developer by night, and an engineering student by day. 
I am studying Aeronautical Engineering with the university of Zimbabwe. I am also taking several computer science courses online with Harvardx. My skills include web development using python and javascript.
I am currently interested in designing blogs because it pairs well with my skills, but I am also working hard on building web apps with react and angular, because that is where my technical skills will truly shine. I enjoying designing UIs that are fun to use, I am also working on some community centered projects, one of my driving goals in to be able to create software tools that can help users to manage their lives better.
