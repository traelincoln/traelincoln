## About Me
My name is **Trevour L Chidoti**, I am a _Blogger_, a _Scientific Writer_, a _Developer_ and an _Engineering student_ from Harare.
I am doing _Aeronautical Engineering_ with The University of Zimbabwe, and I am also learning _Web Development_ using `Python` and `Javascript` online with HavardX through Edx. My github account is where I store my files online for easy sharing and hosting. 

You can view the files in [my public repositories][2] and the links to the live sites will be in each repository's description. 

You can also visit: 
- [My github account][2] where I store the source code for my projects
- [A mock Google Search page](https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites/) that I made for cs50w project 0.
- [My Blog](https://traelincoln.github.io/traelincoln).
- [A simple Sign Up page](traelincoln/signup.html) to get The Simplified Blog post, sent straight to your email.
- [A link to buy me a coffee :coffee:][7]
- [Play a game](/games/typeform1.html) -> a horror style, interactive fiction game that let's you pick your own adventure. 

## My Skills

I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery.
I also enjoy taking pictures, going for walks and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy, I also like reggae and pop. And movies, I like movies too.

## Contribution
I you would like to collaborate you can either talk to me directly here on github or you can feel free to `clone` (download) any of my public repos, make edits via and send them back `pull requests` or just use them as your own. 

### How it works
If you visit [my github profile][2], you can see the source code to all the work I have made public in the folders named `repositories`. The links to live sites will be in each repository's discription and you can read more about each project in the `README.md` file. From there you can choose to clone or fork any repository as you like. To learn more about how to use github you can [read the docs.][6]

For example, go to [My Profile][2], >> open the [`/cs50w-websites`][3], you will see the `README.md` with a short description of the project, >> open the [`/docs`][4] folder to see the source code for the project. A link to the live site, <https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites> , will be in the description.

If you want to support any of the projects, please feel free to [**Buy me a coffee!**][7]
