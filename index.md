Outside of school I also enjoy, taking pictures, walking, reading and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy but I also like reggae and pop. And movies, I like movies too.


## Contribution, how it works
If you visit my github profile, <https://github.com/traelicoln> , you can see the source code to all the work I have made public open source, in the folders named `repositories`. The links to live sites will be in each repository's discription and you can read more about each project in the `README.md` file.

For example, go to [My Profile][2], >> open the [`/cs50w-websites`][3], you will see the `README.md` with a short description of the project, >> open the [`/docs`][4] folder to see the source code. A link to the live site, <https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites> , will be in the description.
You should feel free to `clone` any of my public repos or ask to make edits via a `pull requests`. 

If you want to support any of the projects, please feel free to **Buy me a beer!**
