## Hello, Welcome to my Github Profile

## About Me
My name is Trevour Chidoti, I am <span id="age">26 years old</span> and I am writer, blogger and full stake web developer by night. I am learning computer science and web development on line with [HavardX](cs50.harvard.edu/web) on [Edx](edx.org).
During the day I am an engineering student. I am studying Aeronautical Engineering (aka aircraft design) with The University of Zimbabwe. Right now I am actually working a really cool glider for my 3rd year project.
## Web Skills
I use Git, HTML, CSS, PHP, Python, Javascript, Ruby for web development. I also have some experience with Bootstrap and jquery. For this website I also learnt how to use Jekyll. I also enjoy creating educational content and sharing my demos on youtube.
Currently, I am interested in designing blogs, pairs well with my skills, but I am also working hard on building web apps with react and angular. I believe that is where my technical skills will truly shine. I like solving problems and also I enjoying designing UIs that are fun to use and reduce user frustration. I am in the early stages of developing some community centered projects that can help people to manage their financed and nutrition better.

## Hobbies
I also enjoy playing tennis, listening to rap music and reading books, bot fiction and non-fiction.
