## About Me
Hello there, my name is **Trevour L**, I am a _Software Developer_ and an _Engineering Student_ from Harare, and you have found my Github account.
Github is where I store my files online for easy sharing and hosting. I have been learning computer science for about a year now, by myself and I have had a lot of help from MDN, W3School and Edx.

You can view the files for my learning projects in [my public repositories][2] and the links to the live sites will be in each repository's description. 

From here you can also: 
- [Visit my github account][2] where I store the source code for my projects
- [Check out a mock Google Search page](https://traelincoln.github.io/cs50w-websites/) that I made for cs50w project 0.
- [Buy me a coffee☕][7] -> not manditory!
- [Play a little game I made ](/games/typeform1.html) -> Its a really fun horror style, interactive fiction game that I made using a typeform template, you should try it! 
- Hit me up on Twitter[@traelincoln][8] -> I might be slow but I will reply
- Or send me an email on the form down below.

## My Skills
The programming languages that I have become really good with so far include:
  - HTML 
  - CSS
  - JAVASCRIPT (including Jquery and Bootstrap)
  - PYTHON (including DJANGO and machine learning)
  - PHP
  - RUBY
  - C/C++
  - I am also really cool with Git.




## My Hobbies ⛷️🎿
I enjoy reading books and designing computer programs and aircraft.

I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery.
I also enjoy taking pictures, going for walks and listening to music. I'm a Hip-Hop and RNB guy, I also like reggae and pop. And movies, I like movies too.

If you want to support any of the projects I am working, please feel free to [**Buy me a coffee!**][7] or send me a message on Twitter [@traelincoln][8] if you would like for us to collaborate, or send me an email.
