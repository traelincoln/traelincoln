## So, who is Trevour L Chidoti 👨🏿‍💼 anyway? 
I am a 26 year old Aeronautical engineering student from Zimbabwe. I'm doing my degree with University of Zimbabwe and I am also learning computer science online with edx.

## Skills and Hobbies🖥️🖱️📊⌨️

I am full time student, currently doing my third, so I am kinda busy with third year project right now. I'm designing a electric glider!
But, when I'm not busy with that I like to write other computer programs. I am learning web-development using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON online via edx online. 
And right now I am really into building blogs and static web-pages. I am working on my personal blog and I'm just exploring all many of the web-site building tools out there. My goal is to be able to write programs and build sites and app proffesionally. 

## Other Hobbies ⛷️🎿
Outside of this I also enjoy running, playing tennis and skating and cooking.
