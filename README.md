# TRAELINCOLN on Github. 

This is my github account where you will find some of my work online.

Please feel free to look around.

## About Me
My name is Trevour L Chidoti, a software developer and an Engineering student.
I am doing **Aeronautical Engineering** with The University of Zimbabwe, and Web-Development online with HavardX. So, I have a github to store and showcase all my projects online safely.
I enjoy reading books, designing computer programs and aircraft. 
When I am not reading up on how to optimize the aerodynamic efficiency, for my third year design project, I will be reading up on web-design. 
I am really into blogs right now, I am actually working on [my own blog][1] hosted here on Github. 
I like making beautiful interfaces using Bootstrap and Jquery, you can check out this [mock of the google search][2] page that I made too.
I haven't had the chance to collaborate with anyone yet, so you'd you'd like to work with you can hit me up on Twitter [@traelincoln][3].

  - HTML 
  - CSS
  - JAVASCRIPT (including Jquery and Bootstrap)
  - PYTHON (including DJANGO and machine learning)
  - PHP
  - RUBY
  - C/C++
  - I am also really good with Git.

## My Hobbies ‚õ∑Ô∏èüéø
