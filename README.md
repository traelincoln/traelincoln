## So, who is Trevour L Chidoti üë®üèø‚Äçüíº anyway? 
I am a writer, a developer, a designer and an engineering student. 
I'm from Zimbabwe and I am studying aeronautical engineering (aircraft design) with the University of Zimbabwe.
I'm a fulltime student, so right now I am kinda busy with third year project. I'm designing a electric glider!
And I am also learning web-development using HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND PYTHON through Edx. 
I enjoy reading books, designing computer programs.
And right now I am really into building blogs and static web-pages. 
I am working on my personal blog, I am still trying to find my voice as writer while also exploring many of the web-site building tools that are out there. 
Its really just trail and error right now but I think we are getting somewhere.
My goal is to be able to write programs and build sites proffesionally and also to just get this degree so that I finally say that I am also scientist. 

## Other Hobbies ‚õ∑Ô∏èüéø
Outside of school I also enjoy walking, reading and listening to loud loud music. I'm a hip-hop and RNB guy! And movies, I like movies too.
